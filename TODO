client/server backtest model with OpenCL support

fix git ssh auth
orders (exchange submissions, monitoring, reporting, adhoc)
CURL timeouts & retries
event system
graph export for short / long's (gnuplot?)
iteration testing (option to disable market log and only produce perf stats)
redo exchange & strategy modules with POSIX dl framework (ha!)
decide what to do with order_candles

db integration:
db order history
db winloss history

exchanges:
coinbase support ** almost done but need rewrite **

etc ...

irc:

hodl strat
aggressive strat

wip:
user interface stuff *** SOME DONE ***
